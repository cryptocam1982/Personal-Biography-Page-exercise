  Hey there, this is my personal biography page. This is just an example, to practice what I have learned when it 
               comes to basic HTML. As I feel more confident about this knowledge, 
               I will progress with CSS and Javascript.

                <p class="Books">Books are always good to read, but to be honest, I haven't read one in a while. There are 
                many good online resources out there as well.</p>

                </ul>
                <p class="I-did">I did so many stuff, so I can't really sum it all up here. I'll try to keep it as simple as 
                possible, not too much fluff.</p>
